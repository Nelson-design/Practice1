	<p>Earth is <strong>the third planet from the sun,</strong> and <strong>the only astronomical objecy known to harbor life</strong></p>

    <h2 style="color: #2a8442;">Orbit and rotation</h2>
    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun <a href="#">its mean solar day</a>is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar day is now <em>slightly</em> longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, <strong>each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.</strong></p>
    <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s). Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[187] The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005[188] and 1962–2005.</p>
    <p>Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.</p>

    <h3>Orbit</h3>
    <p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours <b>a solar day</b> for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter,

    	   <li>about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes,</li>
    	   <li> and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.</li>
